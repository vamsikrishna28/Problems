# Problems
Problem 1: Transaction Fee Sorting for Audit Compliance
Scenario: A banking application processes 10,000 daily transactions. Auditors require
transactions sorted by fee amount for compliance reviews.
Problem Statement:
Implement a fee‐sorting system that:
● Sorts transactions by fee in ascending order using Bubble Sort (for small batches
≤ 100).
● Sorts by fee + timestamp using Insertion Sort (for medium batches 100–1,000).
● Handles duplicates (stable sort required).
● Flags high‐fee outliers (> $50).
Concepts Covered:
● Bubble Sort: adjacent swaps, early termination.
● Insertion Sort: building sorted subarray, shift operations.
● Time complexity: O(n2) analysis, best/worst cases.
● Stability in sorting.
Hints:
● Use ArrayList<Transaction> with fee and timestamp.
● Bubble: nested loops, compare i and i+1, swap if needed.
● Insertion: for each element, shift larger ones right.
● Count passes/swaps for optimization.
Use Cases:
● Citi transaction audit reports.
● Fraud detection by fee patterns.
● Compliance fee threshold analysis.
Sample Input/Output:
Input transactions:
id1, fee=10.5, ts=10:00
id2, fee=25.0, ts=09:30
id3, fee=5.0, ts=10:15
BubbleSort (fees): [id3:5.0, id1:10.5, id2:25.0] // 3 passes, 2 swaps
InsertionSort (fee+ts): [id2:25.0@09:30, id3:5.0@10:15, id1:10.5@10:00]
High-fee outliers: none

Problem 2: Client Risk Score Ranking
Scenario: Risk management team needs quick sorting of 500 client risk scores for
priority review.
Problem Statement:
● Sort clients by riskScore ascending using Bubble Sort (visualize swaps for demo).
● Sort by riskScore DESC + accountBalance using Insertion Sort.
● Identify top 10 highest risk clients post‐sort.
Concepts Covered:
● In‐place sorting algorithms.
● Adaptive behavior (Insertion excels on nearly‐sorted data).
● Space complexity O(1).
Hints:
● Client[] array.
● Bubble: for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++) outer, inner j<n-i-1.
● Insertion: for(int i=1; i<n; i++) shift from j=i-1.
Use Cases:
● KYC risk prioritization.
● Loan approval ranking.
● AML watchlist generation.
Sample Input/Output:
Input: [clientC:80, clientA:20, clientB:50]
Bubble (asc): [A:20, B:50, C:80] // Swaps: 2
Insertion (desc): [C:80, B:50, A:20]
Top 3 risks: C(80), B(50), A(20)

Problem 3: Historical Trade Volume Analysis
Scenario: Analyze 1 million daily trades by volume for market trend reports (Citi trading
desk).
Problem Statement:
● Sort trades by volume ascending using Merge Sort (stable, guaranteed O(n log
n)).
● Sort by volume DESC using Quick Sort (in‐place, average O(n log n)).
● Merge two sorted trade lists (e.g., morning/afternoon sessions).
● Compute total volume post‐sort.
Concepts Covered:
● Merge Sort: divide‐conquer, merge step.
● Quick Sort: pivot selection, partitioning, recursion.
● Stability, worst‐case O(n2) in Quick.
Hints:
● Merge: merge(left, right, temp).
● Quick: lomutoPartition(pivotIndex), recurse on partitions.
● Use int[] volumes or Trade[].
Use Cases:
● Citi market volume reports.
● Portfolio rebalancing.
● High‐frequency trading analytics.
Sample Input/Output:
Input: [trade3:500, trade1:100, trade2:300]
MergeSort: [1:100, 2:300, 3:500] // Stable
QuickSort (desc): [3:500, 2:300, 1:100] // Pivot: median
Merged morning+afternoon total: 900

Problem 4: Portfolio Return Sorting
Scenario: Sort 10,000 assets by historical returns for investment recommendations.
Problem Statement:
● Merge Sort assets by returnRate (preserve original order for ties).
● Quick Sort by returnRate DESC + volatility ASC.
● Handle pivot selection (random vs median‐of‐3).
Concepts Covered:
● External sorting if data > memory.
● Hybrid algorithms (Quick + Insertion for small partitions).
Hints:
● Merge: auxiliary array.
● Quick: partition(low, high, pivot).
Use Cases:
● Asset allocation optimization.
● Risk‐parity portfolio construction.
Sample Input/Output:
Input: [AAPL:12%, TSLA:8%, GOOG:15%]
Merge: [TSLA:8%, AAPL:12%, GOOG:15%]
Quick (desc): [GOOG:15%, AAPL:12%, TSLA:8%]

Problem 5: Account ID Lookup in Transaction Logs
Scenario: Search 1 million transaction logs for specific account IDs (audit/compliance).
Problem Statement:
● Implement Linear Search to find first/last occurrence of accountId.
● Use Binary Search (after sorting by ID) for exact match + count occurrences.
● Count comparisons and report time complexity.
● Handle duplicates.
Concepts Covered:
● Linear: O(n), simple but worst for large N.
● Binary: O(log n) requires sorted input, pivot/mid logic.
Hints:
● Linear: for(int i=0; i<n; i++) if(arr[i].equals(target)).
● Binary: while(low <= high) mid = (low+high)/2.
Use Cases:
● Citi transaction forensics.
● Dispute resolution lookups.
● Regulatory reporting.
Sample Input/Output:
Sorted logs: [accB, accA, accB, accC]
Linear first accB: index 0 (4 comparisons)
Binary accB: index 1 (3 comparisons), count=2

Problem 6: Risk Threshold Binary Lookup
Scenario: Binary search optimal risk bands in sorted client risk table.
Problem Statement:
● Linear Search unsorted risk bands for threshold match.
● Binary Search sorted bands to find insertion point for new client.
● Find floor/ceiling values (largest ≤ target, smallest ≥ target).
Concepts Covered:
● Binary variants: lower_bound, upper_bound.
● Prerequisites: sorted array.
Hints:
● Binary insertion: adjust low/high based on comparison.
Use Cases:
● Dynamic risk pricing tables.
● Compliance band assignment.
Sample Input/Output:
Sorted risks: [10, 25, 50, 100]
Linear: threshold=30 → not found (4 comps)
Binary floor(30): 25, ceiling: 50 (3 comps)
